Eight pirates armed with machine guns and RPGs in a blue colored speed boat doing 17 knots fired upon the vessel and attempted to board twice using a ladder. The crew managed to detach the ladder even though the pirates were firing at the ship. The pirates aborted the attempted attack. Coalition forces were notified. The speedboat then moved toward a tanker that was transiting in the vicinity. The speedboat approached the tanker from the port side at approximately 50 meters distance and began preparing the ladder in an attempt to board. The tanker began conducting evasive maneuvers and the speedboat aborted the attack, but then headed toward another tanker transiting westbound. The second tanker increased speed to 16.5 kts before the speed boat eventually aborted the chase. UKMTO Comment: All three vessels were within 4 NM of each other. After attacking the first vessel, the speedboat closed in on the second vessel and made an approach. Weapons were observed but no shots were fired and no attempt to board was made. The second vessel reported that the speed boat made its way to the third vessel, where an approach was made. Coalition warships were informed and a helicopter and surface asset was dispatched (Operator, UKMTO).

The master and second officer were then brought to the poop deck of the ship. The pirates escaped in their speedboat. No injuries were sustained by the crew. ReCAAP COMMENT: Although there is no conclusive evidence as yet, it appears that the same group of pirates was probably involved in the two incidents that occurred in the South China Sea on 30 September 2008 and 2 October 2008. The ReCAAP ISC notes that these were the fifth and sixth incidents that have occurred in the South China Sea area since January 2008. Ship masters are advised to maintain vigilance with all around look-out as per established norms, and take security precautions when operating in the area especially during hours of darkness. They are encouraged to monitor all maritime safety information broadcasts for the area. The ReCAAP ISC encourages ship owners and ship masters to report all incidents of piracy and armed robbery to the nearest coastal states immediately (ReCAAP).

Description:	YELLOW SEA: South Korean Coast Guard officer killed on a Chinese fishing boat on 25 Sep 08, southwest of Jeolla Province. Chinese fishermen are accused of attacking the coast guard officer as he tried to board the Chinese vessel. They hit him with a shovel and wooden stick and threw him into the sea, where he drowned. The fishermen also used shovels and steel pipes to fight 17 other officers, injuring six of them. Korean Coast Guard officials said yesterday that they have arrested 11 Chinese fishermen allegedly involved in the murder. According to the Coast Guard, a patrol ship found the 17-ton Chinese fishing boat and ordered the crew to turn off the engine. Several officers boarded the fishing boat for an inspection. The vessel was seized 62 miles northwest of the incident. The deceased coast guardsman was found six kilometers south of the scene, several hours after he was thrown overboard. Coast Guard officials said that the unlicensed Chinese fishermen illegally entered Korea's exclusive economic zone. Unlicensed Chinese fishermen fiercely resist arrest because illegal boat owners operating without permission face fines up to tens of millions of won. The Coast Guard and Korean fishermen say they are always in danger when they face Chinese boats in Korean waters, usually at night. (LM: JoongAng Ilbo)

Description:	INDIAN OCEANUSNS (JOHN LENTHALL) reported suspicious approach 23 Sep 08 while underway off the central east coast of Somalia. Despite defensive measures to deter them from approaching, the small boats continued to approach the ship. An embarked security team aboard the ship fired warning shots in the vicinity of two small boats. The rounds impacted the water approximately 50 yards from the closest boat and resulted in both small boats ending their pursuit. All shots were accounted for as they entered the water. There were no reports of casualties. This incident is clear proof that all mariners must remain vigilant, said Captain Steve Kelley, the commander responsible for all Military Sealift Command (MSC) ships in the region. I am extremely pleased with the actions taken by the ship's master and ultimately by the security personnel aboard. They initially used defensive measures and when those weren't enough the security personnel took action to defend the ship. While it is unclear if personnel on the boats were intent on attacking the 41,000-ton ship, it is clear they were not following the international rules of the road observed by mariners around the globe. More importantly, the location of the incident, the types of boats involved (small open skiffs), and the maneuvering they undertook was consistent with reports from previous attacks on merchant vessels in the region.

Tension prevailed as fishermen from Thangachimadam Coastal village gathered in front of the hospital to protest against the firing by the Sri Lankan navy. Fishermen told police that they were fishing well within Indian waters when the Sri Lankan naval personnel came ¿silently¿ to the spot in a gas operated boat. The fishermen claim they never fired a warning shot. Top police officials are holding talks with the fishermen, who alleged that the fisherman¿s death was due to the ¿failure¿ of the Indian Navy and Coast Guard to protect them (LM: Hinustan Times).

Description:	GULF OF ADEN:Product tanker reported suspicious approach 1 Jun 08 at 0610 UTC while underway in position 13-20N 097-37E, approximately 23NM from the Yemen coast. Two suspicious boats were observed ahead of the vessel. The boats crossed the vessels bow and then turned back. A third boat was later seen coming from the port side which later rendezvoused with one of the original boats. The vessel made a sharp course alteration to the starboard side. One boat altered its course to parallel with the vessel, about 50 meters away. This boat had three men onboard; one man was seen to be using a cell phone or similar device. The individual using the device was standing up in the bows of the boat and appeared to be reporting details about the vessel to someone. After a few minutes the boat altered its course and crossed the vessels stern. All three boats were last seen heading north. Each boat was 10M in length, two had a white hull and one had a grayish hull, all having a large outboard motor. Each boat carried 3-4 men and were all dressed in white t-shirts and shorts. No sign of any weapons but the closest boat was seen to have a small hold type space with hatch removed. There was no sign of any fishing gear. Security message was broadcasted to all ships via VHF chn. 16. Details of crafts and position given. UKMTO COMMENT: UKMTO called the vessel and discussed the incident at length with the master. The position of the vessel at the time of the boat activity was well north of any reported attack but was only 23NM off the Yemen coast in known fishing grounds. The master felt the vessels were not fishing because he judged them by European fishing habits rather than the local fishing techniques where the fisherman lay nets first then try to coral the fish (generally Tuna in this fashion) towards the nets. The item of note in the report though is the mobile phone. If the phone was analogue then it may be possible to get a signal to phone (and this may explain the man standing up in the bow whilst he tried to get higher for a signal) but it would still be extreme range. GSM phones would not have that range normally without refraction. The other alternative is a Thuraya sat phone or the like. This would be a very expensive luxury for a local fisherman so could suggest a spotting network for pirates. UKMTO are keeping an open mind on the incident and will watch for further trends (Operator, UKMTO).

The crew of four heard unknown voices and discovered that they were boarded from both sides of the vessel by three bandits, armed with a gun, machete and a small axe. The crewmembers tried to regroup inside an area with a screen door but the bandits kicked the door open, however while doing so, one of the bandits hit the smoke alarm and set it off, distracting the bandits. Two of the crewmembers ran to the galley to search for a defensive weapon. Another crewmember was commanded to silence the smoke alarm at gunpoint. It was later discovered that this was a homemade gun, only good at close range. The gunman went towards the galley so that he can watch all the crewmembers at once. While distracted, one of the crewmembers tackled the gunman. The crewmembers managed to throw the bandits down the steps on the transom. A crewmember radioed for help, but received no response, probably due to it being a small port. After the scuffle, the crewmembers had the gun in their possession and chased the bandits. They had two canoes but they spotted the bandits swimming to shore instead. The crewmembers caught one bandit and scared him with a spear gun and tied him up on the swim platform.

ONI COMMENT: It would appear foreign controlled fishing vessels continue to operate in the unregulated Exclusive Economic Zone of Somalia despite the risk of piracy and repeated warnings to stay away. These vessels are easy to target and could be hijacked by any number of potential perpetrators, many of which disdain their presence. This persistence poses a risk to commercial shipping due to the demonstrated propensity for pirates to use hijacked fishing vessels as motherships to conduct additional attacks (LM: Shabelle Media Network (Mogadishu), AP, ONI, LM: Garowe).
