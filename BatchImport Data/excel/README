Notes:
- There were over 6000 rows in original source; to minimize file size, deleted rows after 501st row.
- Original geographic location stored in LATDEC and LONDEC columns; changed columns to LATITUDE and LONGITUDE
- I created the associated .lyrx file manually by importing the dataset, setting symbology in ArcGIS Pro and then creating .lyrx file.
